1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

Think about the UI in terms of small, reusable components.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Functional components don't maintain state but can receive slices of state via props from the parent/stateful components. This gives funcitonal components the ability to be flexible, reusable and scalable.

1.  Describe state.
State is like the heart. It manages all the relevant data needed to run the container and components.
